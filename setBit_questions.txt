setBit :: i -> Bool -> f -> f

How should we describe the resulting f using the proposed framework?

Our thinking is that the resulting function will have the domain {0,1}^(I \\ i), but how do we define this function then?

We also wish to allow any operations that preserve complexity to be performed in this step, how should we describe this?
