Experiments run on the 301-bit majority function.

From profiling:

## Symmetric

total time  =        1.78 secs   (6604 ticks @ 1000 us, 8 processors)
total alloc = 3,945,256,632 bytes  (excludes profiling overheads)

1536 calls to symmetric setBit

## Threshold

total time  =        1.49 secs   (5510 ticks @ 1000 us, 8 processors)
total alloc = 3,544,501,816 bytes  (excludes profiling overheads)
